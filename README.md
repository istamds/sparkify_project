## Project Motivation
In the challenging digital world we are living in it is quite difficult to get an online business running and to build a sufficiently large customer base on which you can rely on. Even when one succeeds in that, he must continuously ensure that the business can retain its customers, one should take proactive measures (discounts, offers, etc.) so as to prevent his customers from leaving the business. In this project, we aim to identify on time users that are going to churn using machine learning methods.
